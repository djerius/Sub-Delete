Revision history for Sub::Delete

0.02    2 September, 2008
        One bug fix: If you call delete_sub with a fully-qualified sub
        name (e.g., "Acme::Soap::wash"),  and there is another slot in
        use in the same glob  (e.g.,  @Acme::Soap::wash),  the  latter
        doesnâ€™t get deleted anymore.
