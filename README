Sub::Delete, version 1.00000

This module allows one to delete a subroutine. Not much to it.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install Sub::Delete"

    [sudo] cpan Sub::Delete

CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

The only new feature in this release is that the  version  number  no
longer begin with a zero.

    man Sub::Delete
