Sub::Delete, version 0.02 (beta)

This module allows one to delete a subroutine. Not much to it.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install Sub::Delete"

    [sudo] cpan Sub::Delete

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

One bug fix: If you call delete_sub with a fully-qualified sub name
(e.g.,  "Acme::Soap::wash"),  and there is another slot in  use  in
the same glob  (e.g.,  @Acme::Soap::wash),  the latter doesnâ€™t  get
deleted anymore.


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires perl 5.8.3 or later.


DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for these modules with
the perldoc command.

    perldoc Sub::Delete

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man Sub::Delete
