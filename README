Sub::Delete, version 0.03 (beta)

This module allows one to delete a subroutine. Not much to it.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install Sub::Delete"

    [sudo] cpan Sub::Delete

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• Deleting a subroutine whose glob contains only that subroutine  now
  deletes the glob as well,  so ‘delete_sub 'clext'’ now fully undoes
  what ‘sub clext;’ does.
• Deleting a subroutine that shared a glob with other variables  used
  to  do  an  effective  ‘use vars’  on  those  variables.  This  has
  been fixed.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires perl 5.8.3 or later.


DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for these modules with
the perldoc command.

    perldoc Sub::Delete

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man Sub::Delete
